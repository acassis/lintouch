License for use of software from Linux Network Services.

First of all, this software is provided without any sort of warranty, expressed
or implied.  We at Linux Network Services do not care what your jurisdiction
calls it, if it's a warranty, we don't provide it.  By your using this 
software, you completely agree to hold Linux Network Services, it's owner(s) 
and agent(s), completely harmless from any possible claims arising from the use 
of this software.

In any jurisdiction where limits of warranty are not legally allowed, Linux 
Network Services liability shall in all cases be limited to the purchase
price (and NOT the licensing fees) of this software.

Please note that improper or incorrect use of this software is the sole
responsibility of the purchaser of this software.  As Linux Network Services 
is not capable of controlling how the purchaser of this software uses this
software, Linux Network Services can not be held responsible for any
implementation utilizing this software.

By using this software, you agree to purchase 1 copy of the distribution
CDROM from Linux Network Services per site, plus 1 device license per computer 
that is using the software.  You also agree to not distribute this software to 
any person or organization outside of your household or organization - please

In figuring out what constitutes a site, we use a "common campus" method.  If
your company has several buildings on the same piece (or adjoining) property, 
that is considered a single site.  Any other arrangement (seperate physical
locations) is considered a seperate site per building.

For figuring out the per-device royalties, we consider any device using
the source code or compiled library(development stations, data collection 
stations) to be seperate devices, requiring a royalty payment per device.  
PLC's are not to be included (unless you really want to) for purposes of 
royalties.
