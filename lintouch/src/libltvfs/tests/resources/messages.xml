    This demo will let you watch and control a simulated real world device.


    The object of the demostration is to move a car along the four parts of the scene:

    1. The car is transported in the right direction by the upper conveyor belt.

    2. Next, it is transfered onto the right platform and goes downwards.

    3. Then, it is caught by the lower conveyor and moved leftwards.

    4. Last, the left platform brings it back to the top and it is transported by the upper conveyor
       again.

    - the system transports the car
      in the aforementioned manner:
      the car goes right, down, left,
      and right.

    - the LED auto is green:

    - the user moves the car using buttons.
      They control the movement of the
      elevator components.

    - the LED manual is green

    The system can switch to the automatic mode when the following holds:

    1. By pushing down the button AUTO.

    2. The system must be reset, i.e. in the safe position:
       a. the left platform must be down, and
       b. the right platform must be up, and
       c. the upper conveyor must be in the left position,
          if carrying the car, or
       d. the lower conveyor must be in the right position,
          if carrying the car.



    If the condition (2.) is not met, the mode
    will not switch to automatic. The operator must
    bring the system to reset and request the automatic
    mode again.

    SAFE POSITION. The cars mark the
    allowed positions for switching
    to the automatic mode.

    The system can switch to the manual mode on error or if the user requests so:

    The user pushes down the button MANUAL.


    Some components of the Elevator system are believed to be faulty. They
    should be replaced in the real world scenario. Read on to find out
    what is misbehaving in the system.

    1. The system stops automatically while simulating the malfunction OVERRUN:
       From time to time, the right platform goes down beyond the allowed limit.
       The user is then supposed to bring the system back to the safe position.

    2. The system stops automatically while simulating the malfunction SLOW:
       Sometimes, the right platform gets stuck and is returning upwards slower
       than it should be. After the system stops, the user is supposed to complete
       the upwards movement manually and get back to the safe position.
