- provide reasonable defaults for all templates, i.e., off/on colors, borders,
  etc
- check all templates and fix their properties/property groups so that they are
  consistent
- handle Template::setEnabled( bool ) to provide reasonable
  "I'm-in-editor-hook"
- fix all strings to contain 'ltl-display' comment and update translations
