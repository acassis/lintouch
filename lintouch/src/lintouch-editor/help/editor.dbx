    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
      Welcome to Lintouch Editor, a visual tool that lets you create
      and manage Lintouch Projects. Lintouch Project defines the look
      and behavior of the control panel(s) in Lintouch.
      And Lintouch, it is is an open-source real-time visual control center.
      Lintouch lets you control and monitor details of processes such in
      manufacturing, security, mass transit and any other environment
      that requires analysis and monitoring.
    </para>

    <para>
      With Lintouch Editor, you can work
      with the Lintouch objects just like in other graphics and diagram
      editors or studios. Some of the editor's many features include
      accurate positioning and mass operation with pre-defined controls,
      context aware tool windows,
      and the ability to preview the whole project - just like it will
      appear in the real working environment.

      <title>What is Lintouch?</title>
      <para>
        Lintouch is an open-source real-time visual control center
        application.  It has been designed with easy extensibility in mind.
        The main features of Lintouch are the server-client architecture and
        the extensibility: using <glossterm linkend="plugin">Server
          Plugins</glossterm> on the server side, and using <glossterm
          linkend="template">Templates</glossterm> on the client side.

        Lintouch consists of two principal parts (see <xref

              <para>
                An application running on a dedicated computer (such as a
                low-profile Motorola CPU) and monitoring your system as
                specified by the instructions defined

                An application running on an industrial PC with touch
                screen, a handheld computer or another device with TCP/IP
                connectivity. It obtains the <glossterm
                  linkend="project">Lintouch Project</glossterm> from the
                server it is connected to and visualizes the state of your

        The behavior of Lintouch Server is controlled by <glossterm
          linkend="project">Lintouch Project</glossterm> (a .zip file with
        .ltp extension containing configuration for the Runtime and the
        Server).
        Lintouch Server sets up the connections that read/write actual data
        from/to the monitored system. Every such connection is handled by
        an appropriate <glossterm linkend="plugin">Server Plugin</glossterm>
        (SNMP Plugin, ModBUS/TCP Plugin or another).
      </para>
      <para>
        Lintouch Runtime connects to a specific Lintouch Server. It
        downloads the project from the server and visualizes the data
        handled by the Lintouch Server. The data are visualized by
        displaying one or more <glossterm
          linkend="panel">Panels</glossterm>.
        Every panel displays one or more
        <glossterm linkend="template">Templates</glossterm> (Lamps, Buttons,
        Input fields) reflecting the real state of the system.
      </para>

        <glossterm linkend="template">Templates</glossterm> are integrated
        into <glossterm linkend="template-library">Template
          Libraries</glossterm> and can perform various tasks.
        <emphasis>Lamp</emphasis> Template typically visualizes the state of
        a <glossterm linkend="monitored-variable">monitored
          variable</glossterm> from your system. A
        <emphasis>Button</emphasis> Template, on the other hand, can change
        the value of a<glossterm linkend="monitored-variable">monitored
          variable</glossterm> of your system when activated by a mouse
        button or touch screen.  This way you can alter the state of your

      <title>Project</title>

      <para>
        On the global scale, you work with Lintouch Projects in the editor.
        A project is represented by a project window.

      <para>
        You can have multiple projects open at once. So it is, you can have
        several project windows in the lintouch editor. Every project
        window updates its caption to the name of the project it holds.
      </para>

      <para>
        From the persistency point of view, a project is represented by a
        file. When satisfied with the look of the project, you will
        upload this file to the reach of the lintouch server and let
        the lintouch server start with this project. Finally, you will
        connect to the server using the lintouch runtime(s).

      <title>View</title>

      <para>
        Every project consists of <emphasis>Views</emphasis>. A view is
        nothing more than a collection of
        panels. In addition, every view has a name and a resolution.
        To skip ahead a little, all the panels within a view
        have that resolution.

        To switch among the views of the project, use the dropdown list

      <para>
        <emphasis>Template</emphasis> is the basic organizational unit
        within Lintouch. It
        represents a real world control switch, button, LED, lamp, sensor,
        etc. Templates are contained within template libraries.
      </para>

      <para>
        The template to use are located in the template palette, a visual
        filling most of the main window. In addition, the templates within
        the palette are grouped by the template libraries - the dropdown
        list just above the palette.

        Lintouch comes with a few pre-defined templates. You can design
        and implement templates of your own. The details of this process
        are beyond scope of this document and may be found at the
        lintouch homepage at <ulink
          url="http://lintouch.org">http://lintouch.org</ulink>.

      <title>Connections and Plugins</title>

      <para>
        To connect the real device to Lintouch, you have to create a
        <emphasis>connection</emphasis>. Connection is
        an abstraction that refers to a device, a PLC, a set of
        devices, or anything that another entity, called the <emphasis>
        server plugin</emphasis>, defines.
      </para>

      <para>
        For example, the plugin ModBusTCP, shipped with Lintouch,
        implements the protocol ModBus over TCP and lets you access the
        remote device from Lintouch. Or, the plugin Generator
        simulates a device that regularly changes its output. In fact,
        there is no limit as to what a server plugin can handle.
      </para>

      <para>
        <figure id="ed-connection">
          <title>Connections and plugins</title>
          <mediaobject>

                format="PNG"/>
            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure>
      </para>

      <para>
        This way, the server plugin tells Lintouch what to send or
        receive with the particular connection and thus acts as the
        type of that connection. To put it another way, a connection
        is an instance of a server plugin.
      </para>

      <para>
        Lintouch contains only a couple of plugins meant for
        testing or demo purposes. Usually, you will write your own
        plugins for your specific devices or let someone do the task
        for you. The interface to those are open and can be found at
        the lintouch homepage at <ulink
          url="http://lintouch.org">http://lintouch.org</ulink>
        Be aware of the fact, the real world plugins may be as
        complex as the real world itself is and sometimes it may
        take weeks to complete them!
      </para>

      <para>
        Once you have written a complex plugin, it is more than likely
        you would like it to work for other instances as well. You
        decide it is only some addresses, or other parameters that you
        need to feed to your plugin to make it work again. This is the
        time when the user should set the properties for the
        corresponding connection. In fact, almost every plugin comes
        with a set of properties that are different from one instance
        of plugin (i.e. connection) to another:

      <title>Variables</title>

      <para>
        Lintouch <emphasis>variable</emphasis> represents the measured or
        monitored quantity within connection, such as voltage, wind speed,
        limit check, or the status of a server. Some people refer to variable
        as <emphasis>tag</emphasis>. The meaning of variable is defined
        by the plugin that handles the corresponding connection. This plugin
        also defines, expects, and sends the variable values as of one of
        the three types:
      </para>

      </itemizedlist>

      <para>
        For example, the weather plugin may be grabbing the temperature from
        one of the connected thermometers. So, the variables of this
        connection are temperatures and are of the type number.

        Of course, the variables have to be distinguished one from another,
        so each variable has a name. In addition, some scenarios require
        variables to have additional information associated with them, such
        as bus address, credentials, or IP address. This additional
        information is called the <emphasis>variable properties</emphasis>.

      <title>Template Bindings and IOPins</title>

      <para>
        A template connects to a variable by one of its <emphasis>IOPins
        </emphasis> to receive and process the data coming in from the real
        devices, or to send some data out to the world (for example, when
        a user presses a button).
      </para>

      <para>
        When connected (the state also referred to as the IOPin
        <emphasis>bound</emphasis> to a variable), Lintouch receives the
        data from the real device by a server plugin; this sets the variable
        of the corresponding connection and the value is delivered to
        the connected IOPins. Then, it is up to the template to decide
        how to react to the received value.

      </para>

      <para>
        The other way around, when a template decides to send out a signal
        (or a number, etc.), it does so by setting its IOPins. It may be
        so that it reacts to the user's press of a button, text input,
        timer event, etc. Then, the signal propagates through the bound
        variables to the plugin via a connection. Last, the plugin decides
        to send the signal out and finally translates the event to the
        protocol of the connected device.

        If you thought about templates as LEDs, simple displays, buttons,
        etc., IOPins would be the interface between the template and the
        outside world.
      </para>

      <para>
        For example, there is a LED monitoring a status of a device. This
        LED is sitting on a bus, that meaning two wires are going to the
        LED's pins. If you thought about the two wires as a variable, the
        LED's pins as an IOPin of the LED, the LED as a template, and the
        bus as a connection, you would get what the Lintouch is about.

        One of the nice features of the editor that makes it stand out
        is the context aware way of operation.
      </para>

      <para>
        Every tool window is modeless. That means you can work with the
        rest of the editor while this window stays open. In addition,
        when the selection, panel, or view changes, this tool window
        is updated to reflect the current situation changed - when applies.
      </para>

      <para>
        For example, you have opened the Template Properties dialog to edit
        the properties of the selected template. When you shift the focus
        to another panel, view, or even a project, the Template Properties
        dialog repaints itself to the properties of the new selection.

          the startup. The template libraries to use must
          be installed into standard locations
          (using the provided installers, for example). The editor then
          enumerates all the files in those locations and tries to load and
          treat them as template libraries.

      <title>External resources of template</title>

      <para>
        Some templates refer to filenames. For example, the Image template
        from Common Templates displays an image file that is part of the
        project. When a file is part of the project's resources, you can
        refer to it by its filename only - or by the name you have assigned
        it.
      </para>

      <para>
        The lintouch editor takes the burden of the resources management off
        your shoulders. It lets you add, rename, and remove resource files
        from the project.

        </para>

        <para>
          Finally, the file will be copied to the project's resources and
          assigned a unique filename. This name is the name portion of the
          filename by default but can be different if another resource
          of that name exists.

        </para>

          Note that every action within the lintouch editor can be reverted.
          So it is, the filename is actually moved to a temporary trash so

          close the project.

    <title>Panels and views</title>

    <para>
      You have learned to work with templates within a panel. For big
      projets however, you will operate with several panels, each of them
      possibly controlling or monitoring different parts of the connected
      device or even several different devices.

    <para>
      In addition, some panels might be controlled via special devices,
      such as handhelds or proprietary devices. For those devices, one
      will operate in a very different resolutions - that when the View
      business comes handy.

      This way, a project consists of views. Each view contains panels.

      <para>
        In addition to ordinary tags, variables in Lintouch may have
        properties associated with them. This allows for an easy
        configuration of the connection parameters and leaves the
        interpreting tag name lists in the realm of crossword puzzles.
        Anyhow, you are not lost even with tag name lists with Lintouch.

        <title>Format of tagname list</title>

        <para>
          There are lots of formats used for tagname lists. Lintouch uses
          the simple and proven, good old comma separated, or CSV format.
          You will have to prepare the file aforehand in a spreadsheet such
          as Excel, Gnumeric, or even a plain text editor. The preparation
          is very easy however. Here is an example of the CSV that will
          import into Lintouch:
        </para>

        <programlisting>
            Connection,Type,latency
            ChemicalSet,Loopback,0

            Variable,Type
            Catalysator,BIT
            Acid,BIT

            Variable,Type
            Temperature,NUMBER
        </programlisting>

        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              Here, <emphasis>Catalysator</emphasis>, <emphasis>Acid</emphasis>,
              and <emphasis>Temperature</emphasis> are tag names. You will
              very likely add like thousand such lines for the real world
              application. <emphasis>BIT</emphasis>, and
              <emphasis>NUMBER</emphasis> denote the type of the input/output.
            </para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>
              The last thing you can see is the header. The very first line
              always begins with <emphasis>Connection,Type</emphasis> and is
              followed by the names of the connection parameters. Sor for
              ModbusTCP Master, for example, this will be
            </para>
            <programlisting>
Connection,Type,host,port,refresh
            </programlisting>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>
              The second line contains the name of the connection,
              type of the connection (the plugin name),
              and the values of the respective parameters on the first line.
            </para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>

        <para>
          And that is all there is to it. If you still fear the formats,
          just create a connection with a few tags within Lintouch Editor,
          export it, edit in a spreadsheet, and import it back.

        If you are starting from this point, you may be just looking at
        the empty project with the idea of the device to connect to. This
        is okay too, as it is easy to enter into Lintouch what is already on

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Create a connection. That is, specify the properties of the
            device to connect to: the way you connect (the connection type)
            and the properties of that connection.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            Next, add variables to the connection. Those are actually the
            data entities, quantities, or measured features of the device.
            A variable corresponds to the single flow of data from Lintouch
            to the device and/or the other way around. The meaning of the
            variable data is up to you to interpret: were it for voltage,
            temperature, pressure, simple check, or the handle position,
            button, or lever.

        </listitem>
