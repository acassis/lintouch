# This is a configuration file defining email reporting for QA Tools.
#
# You should define all variables here as single quoted strings that refer to
# the shell variables called TASK, SUITE, DISTRO, BUILD_START, BUILD_END.
# These will be expanded later when this file is referenced, and their contents
# will be dependent on the QA Tool that has been invoked
#
# for example
#
# TASK will contain the tool name that has been invoked
# SUITE will contain product suite name like "Lintouch", "Gnome", etc.
# DISTRO will be something like "sarge", "ubuntu", "fc4", "suse93"
# BUILD_START and BUILD_END will be locally formated date and time
