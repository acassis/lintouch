This directory contains various configuration files and scripts for
distribution dependent package builders. They are installed along with qa-tools
to your system directories so that they can be used right out of the box

[Note: You need sudo without password prompting in order to use them]

The quality of these scripts varies greatly and they should be considered `beta
quality`. They are however able to acheive the desired tasks on my systems for
the packages maintained by me.

Debian (currently Sarge)
------------------------

[Note: requires working pbuilder, sudo]

First of all, create the build chroot by invoking:

$ pbuilder.debian create

Then you can build binary deb packages and update builder apt cache using:

$ pbuilder.debian build somedeb-someversion.dsc --resultdir /somewhere/else

Ubuntu (currently Breezy)
-------------------------

[Note: requires working pbuilder, sudo]

First of all, create the build chroot by invoking:

$ pbuilder.ubuntu create

Then you can build binary deb packages and update builder apt cache using:

$ pbuilder.ubuntu build somepackage_version.dsc --resultdir /somewhere/else

Fedora/Suse
-----------

[Note: requires working rpm, rpmbuild, sudo]

The following command will build binary packages from .src.rpm and will install
the resulting binary rpms.

$ rpmbuilder build somepackage-version.src.rpm --resultdir /somewhere/else

Mingw
-----

[Note: requires working mingw-builder]

The following command will build binary exe installers for windows.

$ mwbuilder build somepackage_version.dsc --resultdir /somewhere/else
