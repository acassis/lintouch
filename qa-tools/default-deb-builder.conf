# This is a builder configuration file that can be used with QA Tools.
#
# You should define all variables here as single quoted strings that refer to
# the shell variables called PACKAGE, DISTRO, RESULTDIR.
# These will be expanded later when this file is referenced, and their contents
# will be dependent on the QA Tool that has been invoked
#
# for example
#
# PACKAGE will contain something like mypackage_1.0-1.dsc for deb builder and
# myproduct-1.0-1.src.rpm for rpm product
# DISTRO will be something like "sarge", "ubuntu", "fc4", "suse93"
# DISTRO is the destination where we expect the packages to be copied in the
# end.
