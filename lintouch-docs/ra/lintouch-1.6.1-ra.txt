2. What's New In Lintouch 1.6.1

2.1. Global Changes

Lua Server Plugin

    Newly developed Lua server plugin can be used to easily prototype projects
    without any physical connectivity to the real monitored system. It allows
    the users to use scripting language Lua (http://www.lua.org) with
    Pascal-like syntax to manipulate Lintouch variables.

    We are using this Plugin to create simulations of the real physical system
    in the situations where the real system is not available (tradeshows,
    Lintouch demonstration CDs, etc.).

Usability & Bugfixes

    Several critical bugs leading to Editor crash have been fixed.

4. What is Lintouch

Lintouch is a real-time data monitoring/controlling system used in automation
industry and developed by S.W.A.C. GmbH Germany and S.W.A.C. Bohemia s.r.o.

Lintouch is an effort to build fully software-based open source control panel
software suite. Control panels are usually called HMI - Human Machine Interface
, or MMI - Man Machine Interface in the automation industry.

Lintouch supports variety of hardware/software platforms (Win32+Intel,
Linux+Intel, Linux+PPC).

Lintouch has been designed with extensibility in mind. New Server Plugins can
be developed to bring in new connectivity (ModBus/TCP, and Hilscher already
available). New Templates (GUI Objects) can be implemented to define new
control and visualization primitives (Buttons, Lamps, and other Technical
Objects already available).
