After six months of development we (Lintouch Team) are proud to announce the
availability of the new stable version of the Lintouch Server and the Lintouch
Runtime.

This version includes bug fixes plus several new important features. You are
welcome to download, install, test and use this version.

Please see Section 4, “What is Lintouch” for more information about Lintouch.

2. What's New In Lintouch 1.2

2.1. Global Changes

New Project File Extension

    From now on, all Lintouch Projects use .ltp as the default file extension.
    The projects are still ordinary ZIP archives, but different extension makes
    it easier to associate Lintouch applications with such files.

New Project File Format

    To support Panel reuse + keyboard event handling, the format of the project
    files as been slightly changed.

New Template Property Types

    Property types color, link, and resource have been introduced. They were
    needed to make the Lintouch Editor operate smoothly.

2.2. Lintouch Runtime

Improved Panel Rendering

    Panel + Template rendering has been reworked to achieve more readable
    texts. The results are better than what we had in Lintouch 1.0, namely when
    talking about fonts being rendered at small sizes.

Focus + Keyboard Events Handling

    Templates can now define their focus policy (whether they want to receive
    events from keyboard). Once they do so, they can process the keyboard
    events and react to shortcuts. This feature enables the use of Lintouch in
    environments requiring more input devices than just the plain touch
    screens.

Access to Variable's Properties

    From now on a Template can access the properties of Variable(s) it has been
    bound to. The properties of variables usually contain important
    configuration information for the Server that may be displayed at the
    Runtime side.

Template IOPin + Property Grouping

    Namely to support more user comfort while working with Lintouch Editor, the
    Templates can group their IOPins and Properties. A Template can for example
    define "Inputs", and "Outputs" IOPin groups and "Inactive", and "Active"
    Property groups.

Template Localization

    Templates and Template Libraries can be fully localized. This includes
    templates' description, IOPin names, and Property names. Again a feature
    namely useful when working with Lintouch Editor.

2.3. Lintouch Server

Access to Project Resources

    Plugins now have access to the project's resources. We already had one
    plugin that needed access to some external file for its operation. Now such
    files can be obtained directly from the project which simplifies a lot the
    deployment of Lintouch Projects.

4. What is Lintouch

Lintouch is a real-time data monitoring/controlling system used in automation
industry and developed by S.W.A.C. GmbH Germany and S.W.A.C. Bohemia s.r.o.

Lintouch is an effort to build fully software-based open source control panel
software suite. Control panels are usually called HMI - Human Machine Interface
, or MMI - Man Machine Interface in the automation industry.

Lintouch supports variety of hardware/software platforms (Win32+Intel,
Linux+Intel, Linux+PPC).

Lintouch has been designed with extensibility in mind. New Server Plugins can
be developed to bring in new connectivity (ModBus/TCP, and Hilscher already
available). New Templates (GUI Objects) an be implemented to define new control
and visualization primitives (Buttons and Lamps already available).
