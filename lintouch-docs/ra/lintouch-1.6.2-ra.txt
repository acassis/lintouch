   about Lintouch.

2. What's New In Lintouch 1.6.2

2.1. Global Changes

   Usability & Bugfixes
          Templates in Editor can be locked via Project Templates
          Dialog when their properties are set and positioning is
          finished. Locked templates do not interact with the
          mouse in editing mode and thus make it easier to
          manipulate other templates in very complex projects.

   Compilation & Bugfixes
          Swaloun Framework + SharedPtr dependency has been
          dropped, which means that compilation of Lintouch from
          sources is now less complicated.
