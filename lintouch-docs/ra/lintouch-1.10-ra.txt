What's New In Lintouch 1.10

Bug fixes

    Fixed a bug that prevented Modbus/TCP plug-in from running properly on Big
    Endian platforms.

    Modbus/TCP Master plug-in now generates unique transaction ID for every
    variable he is asking for. The previous behavior could have been confusing
    for some Modbus slaves.

Modbus/TCP Master Plug-in Improvements

    A couple of new parameters were added:

    unitid - target unit id. Also known as slave id. Default is 0.

    serialize - 0 means that the modbus requests will be sent in parallel for
    maximum performance of the plug-in. Although the parallel sending might not
    work for some weak Modbus/TCP slaves. When serialize is equal to 1, the
    plug-in will wait for response after each request sent. This is safer but
    slower way.

    timeout - this parameter specifies time out interval for socket operations.
    The value is in milliseconds. Default is 200. Increase for slow devices.

    See Modbus/TCP README for more details on Modbus/TCP plug-in.

New Feature: Data Logging

    A new data logging facility was implemented in the server. Lintouch is now
    able to log every data change that comes through connection plug-ins as
    well as from the Lintouch Runtimes. The data change events are passed over
    to active logging plug-ins, which log the event either to a console, file
    or a remote device (an SQL server), depending on logging plug-in
    implementation. Which logging plug-ins should be active for the project
    might be configured through a new Lintouch Editor Dialog "Server Logging".
    As of version 1.10, console and file logging plug-ins are implemented.

Obtaining and Installing Lintouch

Ready Made Binaries

based platforms. The detailed instructions are available at our web site.

The list of supported platforms includes Microsoft Windows 2000/XP, SuSE Linux
10, Debian/GNU Linux 3.1 (sarge), and Ubuntu Linux 5.04 (breezy). Source RPM

What is Lintouch

Lintouch is an opensource HMI software. It lets you design user interfaces for
process automation. Lintouch runs on most popular hardware and software
platforms, is lightweight and easily extensible.

Lintouch supports variety of hardware/software platforms (Win32+Intel,
Linux+Intel, Linux+PPC).

Lintouch has been designed with extensibility in mind. New Server Plugins can
be developed to bring in new connectivity (ModBus/TCP, and Hilscher already
available). New Templates (GUI Objects) can be implemented to define new
control and visualization primitives (Buttons, Lamps, and other Technical
Objects already available).
