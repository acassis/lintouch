After six months of development we (the Lintouch Team) are proud to announce
the availability of the new stable release of the Lintouch Server, Lintouch
Runtime, and Lintouch Editor.

This version includes bug fixes plus several new important features. You are
welcome to download, install, test, and use this version.

Please see Section 4, “What is Lintouch” for more information about Lintouch.

2. What's New In Lintouch 1.4

2.1. Global Changes

New Visualization Objects

    Lintouch Visualization Objects (called Templates) have been split into the
    following two Template Libraries:

    Display Templates

        containing all templates related to visualization of different types of
        variables in different forms. This template library includes for
        example Chart, Meter, and Lamp templates.

    Input Templates

        containing all templates related to control of different types of
        variables in different forms. This template library includes for
        example Slider, Button, and LineInput templates.

New Connectivity Options

    Support for Modbus/TCP connectivity is available via Lintouch ModbusTCP
    Plugin. The plugin is written in Python and although not optimized for
    time-critical tasks, it can be very effectively used for testing and
    teaching purposes.

2.2. Lintouch Runtime

Industry Ready

    Runtime has been enhanced to support full screen mode, and automatic
    reconnects to the server in case of connectivity problems. All the features
    (such as connecting to a new server, switching panels, etc.) can be
    disabled/enabled on demand according to concrete deployment requirements.

Support for Local Projects

    Runtime can be also used in a local mode in which no Lintouch Server is
    required. This mode is designed for devices without TCP/IP connectivity
    (small touch screen systems) that are connected via industry buses directly
    to the monitored system and always run only one controlling screen for one
    monitored system.

2.3. Lintouch Editor

Support for Connections and Variables editing

    Editor has been enhanced to support full Connections and Variables editing.
    Users can design and test their projects comfortably from within the
    Lintouch Editor. The preview mode can verify the reaction of the screens to
    various variable changes.

Support for Online Mode

    When Editor preview mode is not enough to thoroughly test the screens, the
    online mode takes the project and executes it within Lintouch Runtime in
    the same way it will be finally executed on a target system.

3. Obtaining and Installing Lintouch

3.1. Ready Made Binaries

Lintouch can be downloaded and installed directly on the Windows and Linux
based platforms. The detailed instructions are available at our website.

3.2. Sources

The source code of Lintouch Runtime and Lintouch Server is distributed under
the GNU General Public License 2. It can be downloaded and compiled by hand.
The detailed instructions are available at our website.

4. What is Lintouch

Lintouch is a real-time data monitoring/controlling system used in automation
industry and developed by S.W.A.C. GmbH Germany and S.W.A.C. Bohemia s.r.o.

Lintouch is an effort to build fully software-based open source control panel
software suite. Control panels are usually called HMI - Human Machine Interface
, or MMI - Man Machine Interface in the automation industry.

Lintouch supports variety of hardware/software platforms (Win32+Intel,
Linux+Intel, Linux+PPC).

Lintouch has been designed with extensibility in mind. New Server Plugins can
be developed to bring in new connectivity (ModBus/TCP, and Hilscher already
available). New Templates (GUI Objects) can be implemented to define new
control and visualization primitives (Buttons and Lamps already available).
