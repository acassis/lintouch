Welcome to the ninth issue of the Lintouch Development Weekly Newsletter.

I'm not going to talk too much today, things are pretty clear. Lintouch 1.0
has been silently released[1]. The good thing is that it's pretty stable.
Runtime and the Server both run on Windows and Linux without problems.
Everything has been packaged and can be installed by point-and-clicking[2]
under windows or apt-get installing[3] under debian.

Another good thing is that Runtime has been fully localized to Czech
Language[4]. More translations are waiting for translators. With QT Linguist
it's real peace of cake.

Being tired of simultaneous ICQ conversations we got really geeky and opened
a Lintouch Development IRC Channel. It's much more fun to talk in a huge
group and it has proven to be a rally useful communication medium. You can
find the details in my announcing email[5] or on the web[6].

The IRC channel helped us to fix the two big and for a long time hidden
bugs. One of them being the incorrect exception raising from Python C
Extensions, courtesy goes to Jiri for hunting it down and providing
explanation[7]. The other was well known (not to us) problem with
non-deterministic initialization of static C++ members, here big thanx
goes to Hynek for revealing it in the very last moment and proposing a very
elegant solution[8] (bug never didn't reproduce itself under Linux, but did
thankfully reproduce itself under Windows very often).

Well, and for the historical record, here is the very first screenshot of
Lintouch Runtime running under the Windows[9].
