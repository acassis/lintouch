Everyone is busy preparing applications for the AUTOMATICA 2004 trade
show[3] taking place from June 15th to 18th in Muenchen, Germany. Lintouch
will be presented within the SWAC Booth with several demos which will be
revealed at the right time, but not a minute before.

Optimization storm hitting the Lintouch Common Template Library. Hynek with
Jiri did some testing (in process of demo preparation) and found out that
performance of templates from Common templates library is disputable. Hynek
then checked the code and complained about several operations being
done way too often, usually unnecessarily. He then (using the
"ping-pong-cvs-commit" technique(tm)) enhanced with Patrik the code so that
all operations are done more effectively and affected templates should
perform better now. As a bug fixing bonus, transparency is supported
correctly by Image and Button template.

That's all folks for this week, if you have any comments, corrections or
ideas to be published, feel free to contact me directly[0].
