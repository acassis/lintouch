Welcome to the twelfth (rather short) issue of the Lintouch Weekly Newsletter.

Jbar reworked the production line demo for the Lintouch Demo CD. He has
modified the layout of buttons, improved the overall consistency and made
the automatic/manual control mode very logical. I've prepared a screenshot
of the demo[1]. The code is in the swac CVS for now, but I hope it is
already prepared to be uploaded to the lintouch.org for public consumption.

Lintouch Editor release has been postponed until June 1st. It is mainly due
to the fact that Editor does not handle transparent templates well and
Shivaji wants the feature to be definitely implemented before 1.0 can take
place. Editor tutorial must be also written so that we have a usable piece
of code.

The main focus during this week was on the Lintouch QTE porting. In order to
make Lintouch Runtime compile & test & run without problems several steps
has been taken.

New version of _swac-autofiles_ with simplified QT detection has been
released[2]. _Swaloun Framework_[3] has been patched and released so that it
can now be compiled against regular QT as well as QT Embedded. And finally
code within Lintouch CVS HEAD has been patched and tested to compile against
QTE successfully. A side note is that one must use _cppunit_ without RTTI
support to compile testcases for all libraries. A recompiled debian packages
has been uploaded[4] to the lintouch.org debian repository[5].

Runtime can be now compiled from CVS HEAD against QT Embedded and all
testcases pass. One issue still remains and Patrik is investing a lot of
time to reveal the problem. Texts are not being drawn at all on the panels.
The panel code uses _QCanvas_, _QPainter_ and _QFont_ classes to do the
text drawing and it seems that these classes do not want to collaborate
within Lintouch with QT Embedded. Here is the screenshot which shows the
problem[6].

Last minute info is that Patrik just found an application which uses Texts
on Canvas under QT Embedded and this application works flawlessly.
Seems that the problem is purely on the Lintouch side.

That's all folks for this week, if you have any comments, corrections or
ideas to be published, feel free to contact me directly[0].
