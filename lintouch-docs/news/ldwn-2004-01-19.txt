Welcome to the fifth issue of the Lintouch Development Weekly Newsletter
called by codename "Better Late than Never"...

Because life is not always easy I started to prove this fact by rewriting
our _libwtngtemplates_ library almost from scratch in order to make
templates API easier to use and more transparent[1]. The rewrite took about
6 hours[2] and it indeed was a big cleanup. I'm pretty happy with it right now
and no major changes are planned within next month or so. Patrik already
updated the standard template library to conform to the new API[3] and I've
prepared a patch[4] for Shivaji to ease the adaptation of _wtng-Editor_.

Since more and more evidence is showing that our code in _swaloun-framework_
which handles (by using QT Library) XML configuration parsing is very slow,
Hynek and jbar started (each on its own part and independently) to
investigate where the problem is. Hynek found one nasty usage of operator[]
on top of QValueList which he corrected[5] by correctly using
QValueList::Iterator. No expected speed improvements happened, though not
well proven yet, so jbar (to stay on the safe side) implemented progress
reporting into ProjectAsyncBuilder[6], which means that runtime knows at
almost every moment what's happening when loading a really big project. User
is therefore not left alone and always has a feedback.

Jbar additionally fixed some bugz in _libwtngzip_[7], _libwtngvfs_[8] and
finished last major tasks within a _libwtngproject_[9] making the list of
almost-release-ready libraries bigger again.

Patrik prepared all missing GUI components for _Runtime_ and implemented
necessary logic to make the GUI fully work. We are now in GUI polishing
phase mainly rewriting all messages, choosing good looking icons and
aligning all controls so that our work looks pretty.

The server work seriously started and we have a skeleton subproject[10] which
makes some of the most important C libraries available to Python language in
a CVS. Since Python coding is very comfortable and all C parts are mostly
ready the first working version of _Lintouch Server_ should be available by
the end of this week.

At our today's meeting jbar initiated discussion about all goals that must
be met before the code freeze point which will take place in two weeks,
exactly at February 1. Additionally we summarized all tasks that must be
performed and finished during the testing period that will hopefully lead to
version 1.0 at March 1. Without providing link for the reference to concrete
items I can state that we are pretty close :-). Keep up good work and
crossed fingers and we will make it.

That's all folks for this week, if you have any comments, corrections or
ideas to be published, feel free to contact me directly[0].
