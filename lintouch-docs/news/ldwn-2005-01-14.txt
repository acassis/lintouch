Welcome to the eighteenth issue of the LDWN.

After the discussion on topic of windows packaging, JBar implemented
_mingw-package_[1] software that will create .exe installers for your
sources much the same way debian packages are created. In the end it means
that:

    - one or more .exe installers can be created from the same sources
    - .exe installers are built non-interactively, automated nightly builds
      are possible
    - win32 architecture does not need to be treated differently from unix
      architectures, the process of releasing a package for end users is
      almost the same for all architectures that we support.

At this moment _mingw-package_ depends on MSYS windows shell[2] (minimal port
of bash used by MinGW), and Python, but should not depend on MinGW itself for
compilation (provided you know how to compile your sources
non-interactively).

    2. http://www.mingw.org/

Another good news is that 90% of the Lintouch sources are in SVN[3]. This
includes Runtime, Server, and Basic Plugins (Loopback and Generator). The
build system has been reworked so interested people can checkout the sources
and compile them with the famous:

    ./configure && make && make install

The build system has also been reworked in a way that it does install
everything under specified prefix. If you configure lintouch using:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/my_unstable_lintouch

Everything gets installed under /usr/local/my_unstable_lintouch. This
enables you to install multiple versions of lintouch in parallel (for
testing purposes) and does not pollute your existing system (namely Python
installation where lintouch-server and plugins were installed).

Template Libraries will need reorganization before they can be moved to SVN
and before they can be made part of the official Lintouch sources.

Lintouch Editor is now in a rather good shape and should be released in
unstable version 1.3 as soon as the build system for windows is ready. It
will feature Loopback and Generator connectivity options and will allow
users to play with real world (albeit connectivity limited) projects.

That's all folks for this week, if you have any comments, corrections or
ideas to be published, feel free to contact me directly[0].
