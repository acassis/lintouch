Welcome to the sixteenth issue of the LDWN. I have to apologize for not
being able to send out LDWN issues for more than four months. The team was
busy coding and coding and coding and there was not much time remaining
for PR. I'll nevertheless try to summarize briefly what has happened in the
Lintouch Land until now.

During the last week of September the stable release of Lintouch 1.2 and
Lintouch Editor 1.2 have been released [1] [2]. The Editor has been reworked
from scratch and feels much more comfortable to work with. Template API has
been cleared and enhanced to support keyboard event handling, and
localization of template strings.

The Lintouch has been second time presented at SPS Drives fair[3] in
Nurnberg, Germany. Most of the time in October and November has been spent
by preparing internal templates, and demonstration projects for the fair.
During that time lintouch-dev mailing list was looking almost dead.

Right after the fair our focus shifted on preparations for the new stable
release of the Runtime, Server, and Editor 1.4. The release is scheduled for
March 1st, 2005. The Editor will include full support for connectivity
handling, Runtime will get lot of speed optimizations (much of them are
already in the CVS) and functionality enhancements intended for production
environments (full screen mode by default, no possibility to quit or
disconnect from the Server, etc.).

Lintouch infrastructure is undergoing a lot of changes as well. Among the
most important ones is the transition from aging source code management
system CVS[4] to better SVN[5]. This transition will allow us to develop
entirely new set of quality assurance tools that will help in periodic
build system testing. Part of the sources has been already moved to SVN and
is accessible in our public repository[6].

We are also working on simplified lintouch build system, that will allow
the users wanting to compile Lintouch from sources to simply download one
package, configure it and install. We have seen this need for more than half
a year and the time for the change has finally came.

The website will be also updated to reflect the new state of affairs. One of
the new QA features will be everyday generation of the release snapshots,
and automated building of Linux and Windows packages.

Since we have the Christmas time in Christian World, I'd like to (on behalf
of the Lintouch Team) wish you a very happy holidays and peaceful
New Year 2005.

That's all folks for this week, if you have any comments, corrections or
ideas to be published, feel free to contact me directly[0].
