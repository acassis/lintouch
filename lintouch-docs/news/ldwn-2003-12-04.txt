Lintouch Development Weekly News

Welcome to the historically first (and I hope also not the last) weekly
newsletter from the Lintouch Development Team. I'll try to get this
newsletter out once per week to inform you briefly what has been achieved
in the project and where we are going to.

During the last week of November Lintouch Project has been officially
introduced at the SPS/IPC/Drives fair in NÃ¼rnberg, Germany. Since its more
of a hardware than software fair, Lintouch did not generate too much
interest, however support in real-world integration and testing has been
promised by Blumenbecker[1].

As some of you might have noticed, all Lintouch code, except the editor
(see bellow) has been moved to the lintouch.org CVS. This means that now we
are really public and everyone can download and compile everything we do[2].

Editor has been kept in swac.cz CVS basically because it needs to be adopted
before we can make it public. This adoption means relicensing, ensuring it
contains necessary compilation instructions, etc. This will be done
in the future. I also kindly asked Shivaji through ICQ to provide periodic
report of the Editor code base status, so the next issue of this newsletter
will hopefully include more info about Editor.

Hynek announced[3] that _libwtngzip_, our library which handles .zip
archives has been officially finished and is ready for packaging.
Integration of the zip support into _libwtngvfs_, the Virtual Filesystem
Library was rather easy, so you can expect these two essential components to
be officially released soon.  The packages will be available probably next
week, after some final polishing will be done.

Jiri (jbar) was working hard to get the HTTP support into the
_libwtngproject_, the Project handling (loading & saving) library.
At this moment the loading part is complete and we should be able to load
projects from local directories and .zip archives and from .zip archives
stored at the web server. The test cases for _libwtngproject_ that use
embedded HTTP server[4] written in Python[5] look quite impressive.

Since we always had some problems with good on-screen text output under Linux
with old Lintouch, Patrik did some research and prepared a test application
that displays texts at various sizes with various font configurations. The
application itself will be eventually uploaded to lintouch.org CVS, at this
moment you can already check the results of his work[6].

API for writing Lintouch Templates in C++ is almost finished and Patrik is
working on "legacy" WinTouch Templates. The code is still in swac.cz CVS but
will be moved to lintouch.org soon.


That's all folks for this week, if you have any comments, corrections or
ideas to be published, feel free to contact me directly[0].
