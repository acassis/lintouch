Happy new year 2005 to all. This is the seventeenth issue of Lintouch
Development Weekly Newsletter.

Marc Le Douarain, the author of classicladder[1] (free ladder language
implementation licensed under LGPL) is interested in interconnecting
Lintouch with his Classic Ladder Modbus/TCP Server. It has been clarified[3]
that Modbus/TCP Plugin should be included in Lintouch 1.4 release for free
and from that point the integration effort should start.

Moving Lintouch code to SVN continues. At the moment _libltvariables_ (former
libwngio and libwtngvariables), _libltfsm_, _libltcp_, and _liblttemplates_
(former libwtnglocalizator and libwtngtemplates) are in the SVN[3] and compile
cleanly.

Editor has been moved to the private SVN and while doing Quality Assurance
tests on its code base, several bugs were discovered in Qt's *qmake* and
*lrelease*. They have been reported to Trolltech and confirmed, when they
should be fixed is unclear.

Lintouch Quality Assurance Tool (_lintouch-qa-tools_) are available in
SVN[4] and written generally enough so that they can be used for other SVN
and Automake based projects. Their purpose is to export latest sources from
SVN, configure and compile them, do various pre-distribution checks (make
distcheck for those who understand), and prepare date based snapshot of the
code. This snapshot will be published on the web to make the experiments with
unstable Lintouch easier for less experienced and will guarantee that SVN
codebase is in compilable state.

The QA Tools will now be extended to support automatic generation of debian
packages and windows installers of Lintouch. This should finally make the
release process under windows so easy that the saved manpower can be used in
other areas that need urgent help (documentation for example).

That's all folks for this week, if you have any comments, corrections or
ideas to be published, feel free to contact me directly[0].
