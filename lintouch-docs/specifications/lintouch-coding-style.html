      This article describes the source code requirements used by Lintouch
      Project. Discussed are coding, naming and documentation style
      conventions for C, C++, Python, and XML languages. While this
      document does not attempt to be a once-for-all definitive guide,
      it aims at being helpful for those who want to write code in the
      way that encourages others to read and use it.
    </p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2451814"></a>1. Introduction</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2451820"></a>1.1. Why Coding Conventions at all?</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Writing good source code in any programming language
        requires a lot of skills. Not only the programming language related
        skills but also communication skills. The source code is a
        product. It tells a lot about its author and about the problem the
        code is trying to solve.
      </p><p>
        While the code can reveal how well you know the problem domain,
        and algorithms and data structures design, the form (look of
        the code) reveals how good you are at communication:
        it tells about you in which ways you behave when entering a
        luxury restaurant, how patient you will be while explaining
        something to your kids, how tolerant you will be when talking
        with your friends about music.
      </p><p>
        When people write a source code, they usually put
        in lot of effort and creativity. For some reason programmers are
        weird animals that always think their creativity produces state-of-art
        results. It is not always like that.
      </p><p>
        Becoming a part of bigger project (instead of building seats
        for your own garden) requires adoption of certain standards.
        You have to always remember what are your goals:

        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
              You want your code to be part of the project forever. You
              don't want it to be ripped off just because nobody was able
              to read and understand it.
          </p></li><li><p>
              You want other people to use your code, you want to
              encourage them, you want to be proud of your results.
          </p></li><li><p>
              You want yourself to be considered integral part of the
              team.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>

      </p><p>
        Creating a coding style means agreeing on a set of rules that
        all the members of team are willing to follow. And if they are
        not willing to follow they should bring in valuable comments so
        that consensus can be achieved.
      </p><p>
        Since a lot of code has been already written in the World, there
        exist some agreements on how it should be written, no matter how
        big is your screen, which fancy refactoring-capable GUI IDE you
        are using and what your other current personal preferences are.
      </p><p>
        This article tries to summarize these agreements.
      </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2451903"></a>1.2. Other sources of information</h3></div></div></div><p>

          Kernel Coding Style</a> and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards_toc.html" target="_top">GNU Coding

        quality nor their commitment to Lintouch, I still
        encourage you to read them just to get the "big picture".

        library.

        Every file should contain an appropriate header and footer. They are
        included usually as comments. The reasons for an appropriate
        header and footer are:

        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
              We want to know the author of the file and the date when
              the file was originally created. We can not assume simply
              we would be always looking at the file in the filesystem
              context (file can be printed, attached to email, ...).
          </p></li><li><p>
              We want to know the legal license that covers
              redistribution and reproduction of the file's content.
          </p></li><li><p>
              We want to know some facts from the source code management
              system (such as <a href="http://www.cvshome.org" target="_top">CVS</a> or <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org" target="_top">Subversion</a>).
          </p></li></ul></div><p>

      </p><p>
        Since we are using CVS at this moment, header and the footer of
        a typical C file could look as shown in the following examples.

        </p><div class="example"><a name="id2452746"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 1. Sample header of example GPL covered C file.</b></p><pre class="programlisting">

          </pre></div><p>
      </p><p>
        The very first line of source code file should include
        information from source code version management software (such
        as CVS). In case of XML, shell scripts and executable python
        files where the first line is reserved, the second line can
        serve this purpose.
      </p><p>

        </p><div class="example"><a name="id2452769"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 2. Sample footer of example GPL covered C file.</b></p><pre class="programlisting">
            
/* vim: set et ts=4 sw=4 tw=76:

 */
            
          </pre></div><p>
      </p><p>
        Note that the above example of the footer contains not only CVS
        information tag but also control line with instructions for <a href="http://www.vim.org" target="_top">VIM</a> editor. These
        instructions tell the editor how to do proper indentation and
        formating.
      </p><p>
        While other editors can be driven this way as
        well, we allow only the VIM instructions to be placed in Lintouch
        source code files for the following reasons:

        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
              Majority of Lintouch developers use VIM.
          </p></li><li><p>
              VIM is very mature editor used in all its
              incarnations for almost 20 years now. It seems that it
              will (due to its nature and features) not leave us soon.
          </p></li><li><p>
              VIM is also very tolerant and adoptive in terms of
              hardware requirements and programming languages it
              supports.
          </p></li><li><p>
              VIM is available for more platforms than any other editor.
          </p></li><li><p>
              VIM community supports poor children in Uganda and we
              consider this control line to be kind of advertisement for
              this wonderful piece of software.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
      </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Technical Note</h3><p>
          If you are not using VIM to edit files, you are free to omit
          the control line and not copy it blindly to newly created
          files if there is no way for you to verify that it actually
          works.
        </p><p>
          If you are on the other hand using another editor and want to
          add control line for it, you are required to first ask the
          rest of the community and get their agreement. This is
          necessary to protect the files from being overfilled with
          control lines for ten different random editor applications
          that someone might have used half a year in the past before he
          switched finally to VIM.
        </p></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2452906"></a>2.2. Line length</h3></div></div></div><p>
        No line in a file should be longer than 76 characters for the
        following reasons:

        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
              You usually get 80 characters per line when being
              connected remotely to a system through SSH or when sending
              an email to a (possibly small) portable device. Assuming 80
              characters is the least common denominator among all
              editors, screens and devices available we still have 4
              characters to:
              </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p>
                    comment the code temporarily and not exceed the 80
                    characters per line limit.
                </p></li><li><p>
                    include excerpts of code quoted verbatim in an
                    email without the need to break long lines and make
                    the code harder to read.
                </p></li><li><p>
                    include patch segments created by diff(1) unix utility
                    in an email without breaking the lines. The patch
                    files with long lines are almost unreadable.
                </p></li></ul></div><p>
          </p></li><li><p>
              Even if you have more than 80 characters per line
              available, too long lines require your eyes to travel long
              distances in order to read the lines and thus makes
              working with the code tiring.
          </p></li><li><p>
              Too long lines are rarely needed and indicate bad design
              or wrong source code structuring. Exceptions include
              lines auto generated by source code management system
              (such as CVS) which are usually tolerated.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
      </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2451993"></a>2.3. Tabs and spaces</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Lintouch sources do not use tabs (due to different handling of
        them in various editors, printing tools, etc.). All tabs should
        be therefore expanded into spaces.
      </p><p>
        Indentation level used by Lintouch is 4 characters for C, C++ and
        Python and 2 characters for XML, HTML and similar.
      </p><p>
        Source code must not contain trailing spaces at the end of
        lines.
      </p><p>
        To increase readability all major delimiters (comma, function
        calls, indexing, assignment, comparison) should be followed or
        prepended by spaces (see the following example).
      </p><p>
        Definition of functions, declaration of their bodies and all
        major control structures (loops, conditions) should be separated
        with empty lines to increase readability.
      </p><div class="example"><a name="id2452027"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 3. C source code indented by 4 characters.</b></p><pre class="programlisting">
          
void example_func( int arg1, int arg2 )
{
    int local = 1;
    int arr[ 5 ];

    if( arg1 == arg2 ) {
        local = 2;
        arr[ 0 ] = 1;
    }

    return local;
}
          
        </pre></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2452047"></a>2.4. Formating opening/closing brackets</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Opening bracket should stay on the same line for control
        structures such as conditions and loops, and should be on a
        separate line for function bodies (see previous example).
      </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2452060"></a>2.5. Breaking long lines</h3></div></div></div><p>
        When it is necessary to break a long line it must be always done
        at the meaningful boundary. Good break candidate is for example
        comma in a function call, logical operator in an expression,
        assignment operator in an expression. The break should be always
        after such delimiter. The next line should be indented by at
        least two indentation levels (8 characters for us) to clearly
        indicate that it's a continuation of previous line and not the
        nested control block.
      </p><div class="example"><a name="id2451288"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 4. C source code with lengthy condition line broken into
        two lines</b></p><pre class="programlisting">
          
if( dont_authorize == 1 || access_allowed == 1 ||
        magic_code_received == 1 ) {

    perform_secret_action();

}
          
        </pre></div></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2451309"></a>3. Source code documentation</h2></div></div></div><p>
      Every method that is exported by the library (intended to be
      reused somehow) must be documented in its header file. The
      documentation format we use should follow <a href="http://www.doxygen.org" target="_top">Doxygen</a> conventions (the
      de-facto standard in documenting C/C++ code).
    </p><p>
      For C code that means documenting all methods and potential global
      variables in a header file. For C++ that means documenting all
      classes and their public or protected methods again within the
      header file.
    </p><p>
      Methods that are for local purposes of the library (static C
      methods, C++ private methods) can and should be documented within the
      C, C++ source file.
    </p><p>
      Unimplemented parts (missing method bodies for example) should be
      marked with TODO or FIXME statements encapsulated within inline
      comments. Such TODOs and FIXMEs should explan briefly what has to
      be done in the code, so that other people can jump in and
      implement it while not breaking ideas of the original author.
      Intelligent editors can highlight these FIXMEs and TODOs in a
      special way so that they are not forgotten.
    </p><div class="example"><a name="id2451352"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 5. Unimplemented C method body indicated with FIXME</b></p><pre class="programlisting">
          
int fact( int n )
{
    /* FIXME: need to iterate here to compute factorial for i */
}

      Think twice before using inline comments. They should never
      explain what the code is supposed to do. The code should be
      written in a way that the developer with right domain skills
      should understand it even without inline comments.
      When this is not so, rewrite the complicated parts.

        We are not going to dictate what exactly should be written
        in the documentation. Every high school programmer should have
        learned how to properly document function bodies and class
        member functions.

      Every part of the Lintouch should be tested using the unit testing
      techniques. We are using <a href="http://cppunit.sourceforge.net" target="_top">CPPUnit</a>, a Unit
      test framework for C++. Every library, program, class or a
      function that can be separately distributed as a .tar.gz must be
      accompanied with test cases that verify its functionality.
    </p><p>
      Unit tests must be written by the author of the code that is being
      tested. The author and only the author has the necessary know-how
      of the internal operation of the code; the author is the right
      person to write the "white box tests".
    </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Theoretical Note</h3><p>
        The term "white box testing" comes from the unit testing theory
        and tells that the test code uses the knowledge of the code to
        verify its functionality. The other approach called "black box
        testing" uses only the functional specification or interface to
        prepare the tests. The black box tests might not reveal the
        problematic parts of the implementation algorithm.
      </p></div><p>
      The "black box tests" (i.e. tests not requiring the knowledge of
      the internal workings)
      are usually performed by the QA department. They should
      be based on the functional specifications of the product.

        You can find more on test cases in general on the CPPUnit
        website.  Problems usually occur when testing entities that
        require the real world dependencies (a running real database, a
        user interacting with the GUI, etc.). These can be somehow
        solved using the so-called "mock objects". Whether you decide to
        use them or not to test the piece of code at all, a general
        quote applies:

        &#8220;<span class="quote">
          The amount of code you can test without using mock objects
          indicates how good your design is.
        </span>&#8221;

      TO BE DONE: globals, locals, members, privates, API, what to put into .h
      file, what in .cpp, size of a function, purpose of a function,
      central exit from a function. private methods not in the API but
      on the private d class, private member d class to simplify
      extension and maintain binary compatibility, usage of shared
      pointer and proper implementation of operator= and copy
      constructor, proper use of const argument modifier, value based
      vs. pointer based classes.

        For VIM that means invoking the following commands from within
        the editor while editing a file:
      </p><pre class="screen">
:set expandtab
:set tabstop=4
:set shiftwidth=4
:set textwidth=76
      </pre><p>
        This instructs VIM to use 4 characters as indentation level,
        wrap longer lines automatically as entered at 76th character and
        always use spaces when tab is pressed.

        For VIM that means invoking the following commands from within
        the editor while editing a file:
      </p><pre class="screen">
:set list
      </pre><p>
        It will by default show the end of lines as $ (dollars) and tabs
        as ^I (Ctrl+I).

        For VIM that means invoking the following commands from within
        the editor while editing a file:
      </p><pre class="screen">
:set listchars=tab:»·,trail:·
      </pre><p>
        Basically this command changes the way special characters (end
        of line, tab, etc.) are displayed.
