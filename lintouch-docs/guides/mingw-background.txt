1. GCC
======

There are several compilers for Microsoft Windows. While the Microsoft
Visual C++ (MSVC) has become de facto standard for developing applications
for Windows, no sooner version than 7.1. supports the latest ANSI C++.
And above all, MSVC is not free and free of charge. Worst of all, its
makefiles are not portable.

Speaking of the porting, the quality of the compiler, and the price, GCC
and GNU seem a better option. There are two mainstream ports of GCC for
Windows:

* Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com)
* MinGW (http://www.mingw.org)

Cygwin environment provides a Unix shell (bash) and other Unix like
utilities. It is merely a port of the Unix environment in Windows. In order
to provide full support for the Unix features not available on Windows,
Cygwin contains many hacks and workarounds. These work pretty well in fact
but the application developed with Cygwin have to link to Cygwin DLLs is not
a native Windows application.

The MingW project provides a GCC for Windows that build native Windows
applications which link to Windows native DLLs. Best of all, MinGW is
officially supported compiler for Qt whereas Cygwin GCC is not.

2. Shell
=========

The MinGW GCC package contains tools for working with GNU Makefiles.
Makefile is always interpreted by the current shell. In the Windows
environment, this means ``cmd.exe``. Such makefiles are not portable though;
they cannot be interpreted by the ``sh``-like shells.

Fortunately, the provides such a decent shell as part of the environment
called ``MSYS`` (http://www.mingw.org/msys.shtml). ``MSYS`` contains an old
``BASH`` as its shell.

``MSYS`` contains an xterm-like terminal that works much to the extent that
the today's linux geek expects. In addition, there are several standard
utilities such as sed, grep, ssh, and cvs. The only thing I was missing was
a subversion client but the official svn client for Windows works pretty
well (http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html).
