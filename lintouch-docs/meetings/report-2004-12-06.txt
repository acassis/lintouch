Lintouch Meeting Report

December 6th, 2004

Assembled by Martin Man <mman@swac.cz>

1) Font rendering problems
--------------------------

mman has described why algorithm designed by Hynek on meeting 2004-12-29
does not work for Editor and zoom coefficients different from 100%.

It has been designed that we should examine how QPicture class handles SVG
rendering with respect to fonts, font sizes, canvas scaling, etc. Patrik
will port SVGTemplate to the latest API and mman will see how it behaves in
Editor and Runtime.

Additionally the Text template (from whichever library) should support two
new properties "wrap enabled" and "always fit" with the following
meanings:

- "wrap enabled" (off by default) will allow Text template to auto layout text
  within the Text template rectangle. This could cause the described
  problems with text being wrapped differently on Windows, Linux and under
  different zoom coefficients.

- "always fit" will compute bounding rectangle of the text and chooses the
  font in a way that text will never be clipped and will always fit into the
  template rectangle.

2) Canvas drawing optimizations
-------------------------------

Canvas drawing optimizations are going pretty well. We have started doing
quite intensive optimizations in Editor, which resulted in some strange
artifacts appearing at the panel while moving, resizing, etc., templates.
Patrik is working to get rid of these.

Additionally Runtime should never call canvas()->update() directly but
always from Single Shot timer (QTimer::singelShot( ..., 0 ) ) resulting in
the repaints occurring only when system and application are idle. mman should
take care of this.

3) SVN->CVS transition
----------------------

To make the release process smooth for all Lintouch components as well as
for Lintouch itself, Hynek has proposed to create one top level configure
script for whole Lintouch, that would somehow union all configure scripts
from all Lintouch components. mman will work on this.

The structure of the SVN repository is almost fixed and mman should also
prepare some of the helper scripts to make the most common release-process
tasks simpler. These are namely

- script to branch a component
- script to release a component
- script to package a component

No details has been discussed yet, but all these scripts should provide good
foundation for lintouch auto building and quality verification.
